Platypie is a university recommendation and search engine created for prospective undergraduate students by undergraduate students. 

### So what is it?
As current undergrads (well, most of us anyway), we all had a different path to university. Some of us were lucky enough to have a guidance counselor taking care of most of our uni-related research at high school; others had to resort to the little information we had available to us via the web while connected to spotty ethernet. We remember the struggle to corral relevant information on certain universities, scholarship schemes, course lists, student life from credible sources. Some universities did have their own social media sites/blogs to address certain admissions related topics/issues, but because they weren't indexed effectively, the information was difficult to access. Because of this, we wanted to create a reliable, high quality centralized recommendation and search engine crafted by current student for the benefit of present and future students.

### How does it work?
We loosely modeled Platypie after successful question-and-answer sites such as Reddit and Quora. We wanted to create a sharing platform where current students (referred to as _Student Ambassadors_) could provide firsthand university-related feedback, including information on application procedures; scholarship availability; student life; course selection; career opportunities; weather - especially for lesser known or lesser advertised universities, such us our own - the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The platform is moderated by its content creators. *This means that Student Ambassadors double as content moderators on Platypie*.

Student Ambassadors are current students of universities listed on Platypie who have either been recruited by the universities themselves to generate promotional/reflective material on their behalf, or interested students who have signed up on their own volition. Prospective students can choose to real-time converse with Student Ambassadors using the _Contact_ feature on Platypie by paying a fee.

So our game plan for this? Both current and prospective undergraduates sign in to the platform using their Facebook profile, which gives us access to their data and their Messenger app, which is crucial to our UX (more on this later). Current students of higher education institutions must provide validation of their enrollment by providing and confirming membership with their university email account. Once that is done, both parties can craft their basic information and gain access to platform exclusive information, the most notable of which being _Testimonials_.

Testimonials are snippets of personal experience shared by current students, and they are marked with a timestamp so that readers can see how recent and thus relevant their experiences are. Any testimonial can be upvoted or downvoted by a reader. After a period of time that moderators deem reasonable, these posts will be marked with an _Archived_ flag so that readers are aware that the information is not up to date.

To go along with this, each university, city, major and industry area listed on Platypie has a corresponding wiki page that is written and revised by current students. We've integrated Google Maps and Wikipedia information on the wiki page as well so readers can one-click access other websites for further information should they require.

Each wiki page is ranked by current students on a few criteria out of 10. Likewise, every page culminates with an overall _Student Rank_ out of 10.

Below is a taster of a sample wiki page rank on the city of Hong Kong:
> |Students Rank Hong Kong: | 9 / 10|
> |----------------|--------------|
> |Safety | 9 / 10|
> |Transportation | 9 / 10|
> |Entertainment | 9 / 10 |
> |Career Opportunities	|	9 / 10|
> |Quality of Life | 9 / 10|
> |Price | 9 / 10|

### Similar but different experiences for Student Ambassadors and prospective students
Student Ambassadors and prospective students have the same basic profile, including the below information:
> |Display Name|
> |------------|
> |Graduation Year|
> |University|
> |Major|
> |City, Country|

However, the rest of their custom pages are different. Student Ambassadors see on their custom pages:
* My Shared Testimonials
* Recommended Testimonials feed for their respective universities
* Total views
* Moderator score
* Personal stats
* Incoming messages/requests from prospective students

Conversely, prospective students see on their custom pages:
* My Shortlist of up to five universities, with an application progress bar and, for premium users, a _Contact_ button that allows prospective students to reach Student Ambassadors via Facebook Messenger
* Recommended Testimonials feed of the above shortlisted universities
* An applications planner tool, with _Upcoming Dates_ and other calendar features

### Community moderation and keeping the posts high quality
As mentioned, Student Ambassadors will take on the bulk of the moderation responsibility. To incentivize high content quality, we plan to reimburse the moderators with the membership money that 

### Integration of a Messenger chatbot
There is a reason why (other than being able to access relevant data) we ask every student to sign in using a Facebook profile. We have a Messenger chatbot that serves as a quick introduction to the Platypie experience - 

### Monetization and business model

### Further plans
We want to scrape online course providers such as EdX and Coursera
