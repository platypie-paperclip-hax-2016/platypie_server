Platypie is a university recommendation and search engine created for prospective undergraduate students by undergraduate students. 

### So what is it?
As current undergrads (well, most of us anyway), we all had a different path to university. Some of us were lucky enough to have a guidance counselor taking care of most of our uni-related research at high school; others had to resort to the little information we had available to us via the web while connected to spotty ethernet. We remember the struggle to corral relevant information on certain universities, scholarship schemes, course lists, student life from credible sources. Some universities did have their own social media sites/blogs to address certain admissions related topics/issues, but because they weren't indexed effectively, the information was difficult to access. Because of this, we wanted to create a reliable, high quality centralized recommendation and search engine crafted by current student for the benefit of present and future students.

### How does it work?
We vaguely modeled Platypie after successful question-and-answer sites such as Reddit and Quora. We wanted to create a sharing platform where current students (referred to as _Student Ambassadors_) could provide firsthand university-related feedback, including information on application procedures, scholarship availability, student life, course selection, career opportunities, weather - especially for lesser known or lesser advertised universities, such us our own - the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

So our game plan for this? Both current and prospective undergraduates sign in to the platform using their Facebook profile, which gives us access to their data and their Messenger app, which is crucial to our UX (more on this later). Current students of higher education institutions must provide validation of their enrollment by providing and confirming with their university email account. Once that is done, both parties can craft their basic information and gain access to platform exclusive information, the most notable of which being _Testimonials_.
