### platypie_server
Platypie is a university recommendation and search engine created for prospective undergraduate students by undergraduate students. 

## So what is it?
As current undergrads (well, most of us anyway), we all had a different path to university. Some of us were lucky enough to have a guidance counselor taking care of most of our uni-related research at high school; others had to resort to the little information we had available to us via the web while connected to spotty ethernet. We remember the struggle to corral relevant information on certain universities, scholarship schemes, course lists, student life from credible sources. Because of this, we wanted to create a reliable, high quality centralized recommendation and search engine crafted by current student for the benefit of present and future students.
